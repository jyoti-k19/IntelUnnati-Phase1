# Intel Grand Challenge - Data Analysis of Mobility Dataset

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the **Mobility Dataset** as part of the **Intel Grand Challenge**. The goal of this project is to explore, visualize, and derive meaningful insights from mobility patterns, enabling better understanding of transportation trends, movement behavior, and potential applications in urban planning and mobility optimization.  

The analysis covers data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical insights, and visualizations to provide actionable information.

## Dataset

The dataset includes mobility-related information collected over a period, including:

- GPS coordinates
- Timestamps
- Modes of transport
- User identifiers (anonymized)
- Trip duration and distance

> **Note:** All data is anonymized to protect user privacy.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, inconsistent data entries, and duplicates.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing trends, patterns, and distributions in mobility data.  
- **Statistical Analysis:** Understanding correlations between variables and identifying key factors influencing mobility.  
- **Visualizations:** Interactive and static plots including heatmaps, time series, and movement patterns.  
- **Insights & Recommendations:** Summarized findings and potential applications of the mobility analysis.
